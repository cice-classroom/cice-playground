# CICE - Playground

This repository holds the contents of the [Master in Fullstack Web](https://www.cice.es/master-desarrollo-web-full-stack/). This repository uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to organize the lessons and each module is it's own package.

2. Clone project.
3. Open terminal.
4. `cd` into the project's directory.
5. Install dependencies with: `npm i`.
6. Run bootstrap with: `npm run bootstrap`.

## Collaboration

1. Fork this project.
2. Create a branch from `main` where you'll work, `dev` for example.
3. Track remote upstream branch: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/cice-classroom/cice-playground.git`.
4. To update changes from upstream: `git pull upstream main`.
5. To propose changes you have to go to `main` branch, make a new branch from it, commit changes and then, on Github, make a Pull request from `<YOUR_BRANCH>` to `main`.
